This web kanban is inspired by the paedagogic philosophy of Dewey and Schön.Boiled down to essentials you can say that you don't learn from experience. On the contrary you really learn from reflecting on experience.\r\n\r\n<img src='http://multimusen.dk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/webkanban-20130329.png' alt='Webkanban' style='width:80%' />\r\n\r\nThats why my web kanban has a log.

The intended target group for the application is students at the Multimedia Design Programme at Danish business academies.\r\n\r\nThe thesis begins with an observation: often students hide their work with plans. Often these plans are not only hidden but also quite unusable. Perhaps the students are not satisfied with the project planning applications such as OpenProj or MS Project?\r\n\r\nI began to look for alternatives. In an odd LinkedIn Scrum group I wrote a question: what kind of software do you use in software developing projects? One of the answers really puzzled me. They used pen, paper, magnets and whiteboards for their kanbans.\r\n\r\nKanban is an industrial production method from Japan. It was invented around 1950: “In 1953, Taiichi Ohno applied the principles of just-in-time and Kanban signals to Toyota’s machining factory” (Al-Tahat et al. 2001) In this article the word kanban is explained as:\r\n\r\n„Kanban stands for kan-“card”, ban-“signal”” (ibid.)\r\n\r\nThe kanban concept has been the topic of several academic papers. The paper by (Al Tahat et al. 2001) is mainly mathematical calculations. The paper by (Hung-da and Chen 2008) is a complex industrial solution programmed in PHP and MySQL. Both solutions are not suited for my target group.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for the webkanban came from a rather personal interpretation af the kanban by (Benson et al. 2009). The kanbans are simplified - and used for the management of personal projects.\r\n\r\nIn most projects the Multimedia Designers work in groups. The groups may be scattered all over the planet. They mostly use the internet as a communication platform. Hence a kanban for that target group should exist on a web platform.\r\n\r\nIt would be naïve to asume that you can solve a teaching problem by exchanging one kind of software with another kind of software. The thesis examined the concepts of Dewey (1909, 1938) and Schön (1987).\r\n\r\nIn „Experience & Education” (1938) Dewey claims that reflective thinking is the kind of thinking where a human looks for the explanation of an observation. To Dewey this is the highest form of thinking. In \"Educating the Reflective Practiconer\" (1987) Schön introduces knowing-in-action where „we can deliver without being able to say what we are doing”:\r\n\r\n„When good jazz mucisians improvise together, they similarly display reflection-in-action. Listening to one another, listening to themselves, they „feel” where the music is going and adjust their playing accordingly.” (Schön 1987: 31)\r\n\r\nSchön distinguishes between two kinds of teaching. Model I “(it is) ... difficult in Model I worlds to reveal one’s private dilemmas or make a public test of one’s most important assumptions”.\r\n\r\nIn fact this may be the actual situation, when we teach Multimedia Designers. Not following at plan verges on incompetence...\r\n\r\nSchön and Argyris suggest a solution to the problem, called Model II: “... aims at creating a behavioral world in which people can exchange valid information, even about difficult and sensitive matters, subjects private dilemmas to shared inquiry, and make public tests of negative attributions of that Model I keeps private and undiscussable.” (Schön 1983: 259)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Argyris and Schön concludes that this is more easy to say than to do. Again this might explain why some groups or students prefer to hide their planning methods. But:\r\n\r\n„Under the guise of learning, they actually protect themselves against learning anything new.” (Schön 1983: 119)\r\n\r\nIn Part B is the implementation of a webkanban prototype. A WordPress Plugin is programmed. First ER-diagrams are naturalized and transformed into database tables. Then the plugin is programmed using classes from the WordPress API, PHP and MySQL.\r\n\r\nThe inner logic of a MySQL database is used to falsify Manovich’s idea of the database as a symbolic form. But the opposition of syntagm vs. paradigm is still valid.\r\n\r\nShneiderman’s four pillars of software design is used in order to descripe the development of the prototype (Shneiderman 2005: 121):\r\n\r\nSoftware requirements - is the work and analyzes in part A.\r\nGuidelines, documents, process: the process could be described as iterative prototyping. During the development of the prototype I used a website http: //www.multimusen.dk as a reflective blog. Dreams on code also played a part. (Schön 1987, Jepsen et al. 1979, Bakhtin 1999).\r\nUser interface and software tools: is the implementation of the prototype using FOSS on a LAMP-server.1 A WordPress blog was used as a framework, and the kanban developed as a plugin to WordPress. Hence the code made use of objectoriented code and the WordPress API. 1 LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP 7\r\nUser testing - was done during all stages of development. But towards the deadline for the thesis a think-aloud-test inspired by (Tognazzini 1990 Ch. 14) was made on four test persons. Every test gave rise to improvements of the prototype.\r\n\r\nA simplified version of the webkanban code is found in § 7.3. For IT lecturers Open Source har many advantages. Richard Stallman express the vital importance of free code thus:\r\n\r\n„... they promote social solidarity—that is, sharing and cooperation.”\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point. html (dato: 2.5. 2013)\r\n\r\nMuch of the work in a trade according to Schön et al. is tacit knowledge. Open Source on the other hand gives the IT lecturers an advantage. You can actually share and show how certain things are made.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the thesis sees the webkanban prototype as a strategic tool in the toolbox of the business academies. The webkanban is a tool that could be used for project management. But the development process described in this thesis is also an example of the reflections of a fellow practiconer.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
